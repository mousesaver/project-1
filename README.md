# Treasure Hunt

## About the Game

Let's start the treasure hunt! Two players will compete to see who finds more treasures. There are many categories to choose from. Once a category is selected, players have to click on squares alternatively to reveal what's hidden inside. If the item is in the right category, the corresponding player will score one point. When all squares have been revealed, the player with the higher scores will be the winner and the game is over.

## Post-project reflection

- I have made the computer player smart on different levels. To make the game better, the layout can be better designed and proper sound can be added.
